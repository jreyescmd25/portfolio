It involved her loved ones back on earth, ofc her owner and his family. She saw how Emperor Bro would ultimately finish humanity and other species by turning them into abominations and ultimately getting rid of every organism that exists, thus without hesitation she asks for the next steps where this one female (Perlimon) tells her to find a specific depressed bird (her husband) to help along the way to find the right guy for the job so that he can rescue her owner so they can team up to finish him off. </p>

Matter a fact, he was known to be incredibly happy and patient since he had a beloved wife on his side, going on adventures, sharing and celebrating the most life and sharing family time with the kids. Until one day, his wife went missing and lost her around a waterfall, when being attacked by a flock of large eagles, hence why he hates the statues David obtains throughout their missions.</p>

He does not necessarily know English when he saw a message on the guy’s phone and saw a text saying ”bro” he thought it was cool. He originates in Kepler-b420 where he plans to share his power with the rest of his planet to ultimately rule the universe</p>

He felt like it was an amazing time to strike when Emperor Bro was unleashing his Havoc and of course when it comes to treasure, he’s out his ears, nose, and eyes wide open ready to trade for some quick cash !</p>

                    <p class="dev-bio">As of now, Project: Codename Yessir is in an early prototype stage of development. The core structure, narrative flow, UI layouts, and overall game concept have been fully designed and documented. A playable prototype is currently available to download, featuring implemented dialogue scenes, a functional title screen, and core presentation systems. Development is actively progressing toward player-controlled gameplay, with the next major milestone focusing on enabling the player to take  control of David following the opening dialogue sequences. This project currently is primarily a solo-developed effort, with additional support from collaborators who contributed voice acting for select scenes.</p>
